Release 0.3 is close!
=====================
I think I'm almost ready to release again Pomodori after the introduction of the history view. Basically pomodoro counts are now clickable and a table shows up with timestamps and descriptions for yesterday's or today's pomodoros worked. The table is useful to see at the beginning of the day what was done yesterday very quickly. Try it at your next stan-up meeting!

There are also important performance improvements, UI tweaks and internal architectural changes. Stay tuned.

700+ pomodoros
-------------
I'm happy to see the pomodoro count increasing so fast. The more data are stored in Pomodori the more I can inspect about my practice and improve. Cool.

*Happy pomodoros to all*
