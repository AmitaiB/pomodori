SESSION NOT DONE
----------------

STANDUP
-------
* Last session I was able to close release 0.2
* Today I need to finish ChiRb slides for tonight's talk
* Planning on a 2 pomodoros presentation
* I'll leave the last part for the train tonight

POMOSPECTIVE
------------
* Short breaks, I felt the pressure of closing the slides with the time available
* Too bad, but I got the slides done

INTERRUPTIONS
-------------
* \@external starbucks full of smoke and noisy, had to move to caribou
* \@internal lost replying tweets, sigh. Voided, lost 5 mins and relaxing during the break! Damn all the free wifi.

RAW DUMP
