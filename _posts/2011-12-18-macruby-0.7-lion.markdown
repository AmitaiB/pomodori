title: Latest Pomodori 0.7 now compatible with Lion
---

Pomodori 0.7 is out!
==============================
Hi all, I found a few hours today to fix Pomodori compatibility with the new Mac OS X Lion release. No new feature or bug fixing unfortunately. I should have some more time to evolve Pomodori the next year (2012) after I'm done with some important client work. Please accept my apologies for being so late.

*Happy Pomodoros*
