* \@pomodori \@yestpomo history view with grid table view showing list of pomodoros 4 => 4
* \@pomospective 1

SESSION NOT DONE
----------------

STANDUP
-------
* Yesterday I did some UI work to compact the view and some design for the yestpomo story
* Today I'd like to close the full yesterday's pomo story
* Today: strictly observe breaks(!) Next email check during long break. Full stop!

POMOSPECTIVE
------------
* I can do better for my 4 pomos longer breaks. Do I really really have to read the email? Should I start scheduling a working pomo for that instead? The reason is: reading emails/tweets is brain consuming.
* I thought allocating only 8 when I see a potential of 11-12 was not enough. But I had my 2 longer breaks (12-2) plus sometimes I don't stop right away after the 25 mins and I do another 5 (12-2-1) and I started allocating for the pomospective (12-2-1-1)
* So if you see a potential of 12 allocate a (-3) 9. If you see a 16 (a full day) allocate for a 12 (-4).
* I underestimated the lenght of the history story. So today I'm not done. The problem is that I need to spend more time than expected for things like the table view to understand how the work.
* Next time, for a full story, allocate more than the impression of what needs to be done.
