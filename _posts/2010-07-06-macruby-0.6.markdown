title: Upgrade to MacRuby 0.6
---

Pomodori 0.6 is out!
==============================
Pomodori developement is running slower than ever. Clients work is keeping me solid busy and I can just throw in a few hours a month to quick fix major bugs. This time I also updated MacRuby to the latest release. No big trouble here. There was also a problem on case sensitive Mac file systems that should be solved now.

Hoping things will move faster after the summer. 

*Happy Pomodoros*
